# 📝 To-Do List Project
A simple To-Do List application written in Python.  
This project was created to learn Python OOP and explore more advanced Python concepts such as class methods, static methods, and file handling.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks  
- Save and load tasks from a local file  
- Simple and clean CLI interface

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and objects  
- Advanced Python features:
  - Class methods and static methods  
  - Decorators and `@property` usage  
  - File handling with CSV  
- Code organization:
  - Separation of concerns using multiple files/modules
  - **Factory Method Pattern** used to dynamically create different `FileHandler` and `UI` types  
  - Following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern conceptually  
- Clean and maintainable code structure

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- [ ] Add support for saving and loading tasks using **JSON** for more structured file handling  
- [ ] Build a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using:
  - **Tkinter** (basic desktop UI)
  - **PyQt5** (more advanced and modern desktop UI)
